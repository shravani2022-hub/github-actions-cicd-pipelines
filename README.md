- Runs unit tests (test_sample.py)
- Automatically builds and validates Python code
- Can be extended to deploy to staging or production environments

## Files
- app.py - Sample Python application
- test_sample.py - Simple unit test
- .github/workflows/python_app.yml - GitHub Actions workflow configuration

## Outcome
Successfully automated testing and integration of code using GitHub Actions.
